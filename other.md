## Last Month's Highlighted VOD ##

Jevil Nohit and Melty Blood! (September 30th, 2021)

Just looking for simple things I could do alone while in college, I streamed some attempts of me trying to beat Deltarune's Jevil fight without being hit. Afterwards, I spent a while chilling out before playing a bit of Melty Blood which had come out just then.

## Latest Video ##

After 9 months, I have yet another video!! This is a compilation of my runs through the Prophecy dungeon to obtain the weapons of the nine.

I actually am already working on a new video that isn't Destiny 2 related, so there should be another soon! For now, however, I hope you guys enjoy watching this!
