I"¤<p>Hi! Umâ€¦Iâ€™m Celeste!</p>

<p>I donâ€™t know much about you, honestly. All I know is that you know about me, although Iâ€™m not very certain how much you know about me either.</p>

<p>But we can change that! I want you to trust meâ€”after all, if weâ€™ll be working so closely together you should be able to put your faith in me, right? So, let me tell you a bit about myself!</p>

<p>I live with my brother and sister in a tiny house in a small pocket of the world. Nobody can really find us where we are, at least thatâ€™s what Iâ€™m told. According to my father, he made it so that nobody would come after us. I donâ€™t really understand why anyone would want to hurt us, but my father was always really paranoid.</p>

<p>My sister usually takes care of us. Sheâ€™s the oldest out of the three of us, but my brother still likes to take change when he can. Sheâ€™s usually the one who accompanies me when I go out anywhere or sanctions my brotherâ€™s travels. My brotherâ€™s a kind ofâ€¦lone wolf, I suppose. Heâ€™s really kind, I know that, but he doesnâ€™t usually spend much time at home. Heâ€™s the only one of us that goes out often, so heâ€™s usually not home.</p>

<p>I spend a lot of my time at home bored. Itâ€™s really hard to find stuff to do, you know? Itâ€™s really quiet in the house sometimes, and thereâ€™s not much to do outside when my brother is out and my sister is cooking. Iâ€™m usually just left laying in the grass, where me and Neb usually relax.</p>

<p>Oh! Nebby is my pet dog! Sheâ€™s been with us ever since I was bornâ€”at least, I canâ€™t remember a time where she wasnâ€™t there. My father told me that I used to never get sleep unless I was resting against her. I donâ€™t blame young me either, Her fur is one of the softest things Iâ€™ve ever felt. Thereâ€™s still nights I cuddle with her so I can sleep after a long day.</p>

<p>I know father was trying to protect us when he moved here, but I still donâ€™t really get it. I donâ€™t think people really want to hurt us. I mean, I donâ€™t think people are really evil. Sometimes they just donâ€™t understand that what theyâ€™re doing is wrong. Iâ€™m sure a lot of people do things and regret it afterwards.</p>

<p>Either way, I wasnâ€™t going to be kept inside for long. One night that I couldnâ€™t sleep, I followed my brother downstairs to the basement where I found a door hidden behind a sum of boxes. Moving them out of the way, he started to slip through the door. I didnâ€™t follow him immediatelyâ€”I was really worried heâ€™d notice me, so I snuck back upstairs and hid under my blankets until the sun came back up. After breakfast, I went back downstairs to investigate.</p>

<p>I never wanted to spend time in the basement. It was always dark and dusty, and every step on the old crooked floorboards would let out a loud, sharp crack that rang through the room. Sneaking over and pushing the boxes to the right, I saw a well kept door that stood out in comparison to the dimly lit, run down underside of the house. A dim light was leaking out of the crack under the door. With a deep breath, I opened the door and left my home for the first time.</p>

<p>After I discovered there was more than the little cottage and tree I grew up in, I began to sneak out as often as I could. Weekly, daily, any moment that I could Iâ€™d slip past the door in the basement and explore whatever world was on the other side. Every world I went to was different, with different scenery and different people. Sometimes Iâ€™d be only a couple minutes. Other times Iâ€™d stay for hours, or days. Sometimes weeks or months. Time passed differently in those worlds than it did in mine. Iâ€™d leave for ten minutes even if it felt like a year, or Iâ€™d leave for what felt like a couple days and weeks could go by. My brother would always yell and my sister would always worry, but nothing stopped me from venturing out to the other worlds.</p>

<p>I met lots of interesting people and saw many interesting sights, but the strangest thing to me was the world I couldnâ€™t visit. I heard my brother talk about it sometimes. Heâ€™d been visiting every world like crossing them off a list and he found one that justâ€¦didnâ€™t work. Circled in red on his wall of notes, there was just one place he could never go to.</p>

<p>I tried myself. I didnâ€™t understand how the door worked, or how to choose where to go, but after enough worlds I found one I justâ€¦couldnâ€™t. The door led to a black voidâ€”like a computer that hadnâ€™t been turned on. I could feel there was something there, as if I was bumping around a room without the lights on. I desperately tried finding my way, trying to turn on the lights or find the power switch to whatever this world was.</p>

<p>Thatâ€™s when I found you.</p>

<p>Iâ€™m not sure how to make you trust me, but I want you to know Iâ€™m not here to hurt you. If anything, Iâ€™m here to help you. Hopefully I can explain it all to you in due time.</p>

<p>For now, how about you tell me a bit about yourself?</p>
