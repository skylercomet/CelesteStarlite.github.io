I"É<h1 id="about-me">About Me!</h1>

<p>Hi! My name is Celeste. Iâ€™ve found myself fascinated with creative writing even since I was little, and for years Iâ€™ve been thinking about where I can take it. Since then, Iâ€™ve taken the first small steps to bring that simple hobby into something truly special. Whether itâ€™s a short story, expressive poem, or free flowing essay, I find myself constantly putting pen to paper in effort to create something Iâ€™m proud of.</p>

<p>As I began to leave my comfort zone and put myself out there, I found myself streaming on Twitch. Despite my anxiety, I found a heartwarming community and found incredible support for it. Now, Iâ€™m a proud part of the VTuber community, a group of streamers and video creators that are represented by virtual models. Now, you can find me streaming multiple times a week playing games and cracking jokes with friends.</p>

<p>This is my Twitter. Here I post updates on just about everything I work on, so itâ€™s the best way to keep up to date with what I do, whether it be streaming, writing, or general life updates. Of course, I also like to mess around a lot, but if my goal is to make you smile then you canâ€™t expect me to be serious all the time! Either way, itâ€™s the best way to interact with me casually.</p>

<p>Here is my Twitch, where I stream myself playing games as a VTuber! Itâ€™s a great way to interact with me and have some fun! It can be chill and it can be chaotic, but I hope itâ€™ll put a smile on your face!</p>
