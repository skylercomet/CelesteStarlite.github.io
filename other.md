## Last Month's* Highlighted VOD ##

It Takes Two but we're literally at each others' throats (January 2nd, 2022)

*This is not last month lol

I didn't have a lot of vods from January to March because I was on break to focus on classes! I instead want to highlight one of the biggest things I did, which was a playthrough of It Takes Two with my brother! Only part one of course, the second is on the channel afterwards :3
