## Last Month's Highlighted VOD ##

Celeste's Return Stream! (July 23rd, 2021)

After almost 5 weeks, I returned to streaming. This is what occured. (Also ignore the first play of the video at the beginning there was no audio because of a glitch orz)

## Latest Video ##

Destiny 2 Raid Highlights, which is my first edited video! I'm really excited to make more and hone my skills, but for now this video is something I'm really proud of. Even if you don't play Destiny, I think it is still enjoyable to watch so I hope you check it out!
